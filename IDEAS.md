# Ideas

A running list, kept in the repo so it outlives the conversation that produced
it. Nothing here is a commitment; several entries argue against each other.

Each entry carries a status, because the difference matters:

| Status | Means |
|--------|-------|
| **measured** | There are numbers in `bench/results/`, or a run reproduced in this repo |
| **verified** | The mechanism was demonstrated working, without a full measurement |
| **hypothesis** | Plausible, untested — do not cite as fact |
| **open** | A question, not yet a proposal |

## 1. Correctness — the seal that shouldn't have served

The thing that makes Nestor Nestor is that a tier-1 answer is served verbatim,
marked verified, with no review queue. So the failure mode that matters is a
phrase which was never verified being served as though it were. Everything in
this section is downstream of that.

### 1.1 Margin, not just magnitude — **measured; mostly falsified**

*The hypothesis was: a false seal happens when many sealed rows resemble the
probe about equally, so the gap between best and second-best should separate a
genuine match from a coincidental one — attacking false seals without the recall
cost of raising the threshold. I called it the highest-value change on this list.
It is not.*

`bench_margin.py`, threshold 0.92, false-seal % / recall %
(`bench/results/margin.json`):

| margin | boil 2k | boil 8k | boil 24k | prose 2k | prose 4k |
|-------:|--------:|--------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| 0.00 | 1.6 / 100 | 8.0 / 100 | 16.0 / 100 | 4.8 / 99.6 | 6.8 / 100 |
| 0.03 | 1.6 / 100 | 6.0 / 100 | 10.0 / 99.2 | 4.4 / 99.2 | 6.4 / 98.0 |
| 0.05 | 1.6 / 99.6 | 3.2 / 98.4 | **4.0 / 96.8** | 4.4 / 96.8 | 6.0 / 93.6 |
| 0.10 | 0.0 / 91.2 | 0.4 / 70.8 | 0.0 / **44.4** | 3.6 / 91.6 | 5.2 / 88.4 |

**On homogeneous text it half-works.** Boilerplate 24k at margin 0.05 cuts false
seals 16.0% → 4.0% for 3.2 points of recall. Real, but not free, and nowhere near
the clean separation the hypothesis predicted — pushing to 0.10 eliminates false
seals and destroys recall (44%).

**On prose it does nothing but cost recall.** 6.8% → 6.0% at margin 0.05 while
recall falls 100% → 93.6%. Strictly worse than simply raising the threshold.

The distributions overlap, which is the real verdict. Gap between true-match p10
and false-seal p90 — positive means separable:

| | boil 2k | boil 8k | boil 24k | prose 2k | prose 4k |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| gap | +0.018 | −0.001 | +0.012 | −0.050 | −0.103 |

**Why it fails, which is the part worth keeping.** The hypothesis assumed false
seals arise from *crowding* — many near-equal candidates. That is true only in
templated corpora. In prose a false seal comes from a **genuine near-duplicate**:
one sentence that really is nearly identical to the probe, with nothing else
close. So the margin is *wide* precisely when the answer is wrong, and the signal
inverts. Crowding is an artifact of homogeneous text, not a property of false
seals.

Not worth shipping as a global rule. Possibly worth it as a per-domain option for
templated corpora, where it beats raising the threshold — but §1.3's calibration
work should decide that, not this idea on its own.

Caveat on the recall column here: `bench_margin.py` still uses the **surface**
perturbations, where most probes score exactly 1.0, so its margin is
`1.0 − second` and the recall cliff at 0.10 is partly an artifact of how close
the rest of the corpus sits to an exact match. Re-running it against the
paraphrase tier would only make the verdict more negative — paraphrase probes
score lower, so their margins are narrower — so it was not worth re-running to
overturn a conclusion that is already "no". The false-seal column never depended
on the perturbation set.

**What the failures actually look like, and why no scalar rule catches them.**
Every worst-case collision differs from the phrase it was served *only in the
identifier*:

```
asked : the joint term triggers any joint breach under section 5386
served: the joint term triggers any joint breach under section 756    sim=0.974
```

A character-ratio matcher is blind to *which* characters carry the meaning. 0.974
clears any cutoff that preserves recall, and the margin measurements above show
the runner-up gap does not reliably collapse either. So neither threshold nor
margin — the two knobs available on top of a scalar similarity — can separate
these. The fix has to change what is being *compared*: weight identifier-like
tokens, or go semantic (§3.1/§3.3).

### 1.2 Negative seals — **shipped**

*Was: a human could seal "this match is right" but never record "this match is
wrong," so a bad fuzzy hit came back identically forever and human attention
leaked out of the system.*

Implemented as two distinct refusals, because collapsing them would have been a
bug:

* **`reject_pair(pair_id, …)`** — the mapping itself is wrong. Sets
  `status='rejected'`; never served, never offered as engine context again.
* **`reject_match(source_text, …, pair_id=/target_text=)`** — *this pair is the
  wrong answer for this query*. The pair stays valid for its own source text.

The second is the false-seal case from the bench, and it is the one that had no
home in the schema. A false seal is a **correct** pair matched to the wrong
input, so rejecting the pair would destroy a good verification. It needed a new
table (`tm_rejections`) keyed on the query, not on the pair.

Design decisions worth remembering:

* **Enforcement lives in `lookup()`**, not `best_sealed()`. Every serve path —
  `best_sealed`, engine TM context, the entity resolver, the reconciler — goes
  through `lookup`. Filtering one level up would have left a rejected pair still
  reaching the engine's system prompt as authoritative reference material.
* **Rejections are honored even when their signature does not verify**, which is
  the opposite of how seals are treated. The two fail in opposite directions:
  honoring a forged seal serves unverified content as verified, whereas honoring
  a forged rejection merely withholds an answer and degrades to human review —
  the defined safe state. It grants an attacker nothing either, since writing a
  forged rejection needs store write access, and anyone with that could delete
  the sealed row instead. Validity is still recorded and surfaced via
  `rejection_signature_report` for the curator.
* **Rejection signatures are domain-separated** from seal signatures (a literal
  `"rejection"` tag as element 0 of the signed message), so one can never be
  replayed as the other.
* **The capability is optional and all-or-nothing.** A host store predating it
  keeps working; `supports_rejection()` reports partial implementations as no
  support, because writing rejections nobody reads back is worse than not having
  the feature. `reject_*` raises rather than silently dropping a human's "no".

Remaining: nothing consumes rejections as *training signal* — a query with
several rejections is a strong hint that the threshold is wrong for that domain
(§1.3), and a pair rejected against many different queries is a hint the pair
itself is junk. Both are now recorded and unread.

### 1.3 The threshold should be calibrated, not constant — **measured**

`SEAL_THRESHOLD = 0.92` is a single global constant across every domain, and no
single value works. Complete sweep, 250 probes per cell, false-seal rate
(`bench/results/accuracy.json`):

| threshold | boil 500 | boil 2k | boil 8k | boil 24k | prose 500 | prose 2k | prose 4k |
|-----------|---------:|--------:|--------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|
| 0.90 | 2.8% | 10.8% | 36.4% | 56.4% | 2.4% | 5.6% | 10.0% |
| **0.92** (shipped) | 0.4% | 1.6% | 8.0% | **16.4%** | 2.0% | 4.8% | 6.8% |
| 0.94 | 0.0% | 0.4% | 1.6% | 4.8% | 0.8% | 4.0% | 3.6% |
| 0.96 | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.2% | 0.4% | 0.0% | 1.2% | 1.6% |
| 0.98 | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.4% | 0.8% |

**The "free six points" claim this section used to make is dead.** It rested on a
recall column measured with perturbations that normalization erased. With a real
paraphrase tier (`bench_accuracy` now reports `recall_surface` and
`recall_paraphrase` separately), raising the threshold is expensive:

| threshold | boil 24k false-seal | boil 24k paraphrase recall | prose 4k false-seal | prose 4k paraphrase recall |
|-----------|--------------------:|---------------------------:|--------------------:|---------------------------:|
| 0.90 | 56.4% | 38.4% | 10.0% | 62.4% |
| **0.92** | 16.4% | **23.6%** | 6.8% | **60.0%** |
| 0.94 | 4.8% | 6.8% | 3.6% | 56.0% |
| 0.96 | 0.4% | 2.4% | 1.6% | 43.6% |
| 0.98 | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.8% | 15.6% |

Surface recall reads 100% in every one of those cells. That gap *is* the finding:
the old column measured whether near-identical input still matches, which was
never in question.

**There is no threshold that is simultaneously safe and useful.** At 0.96 the
24k boilerplate case is clean (0.4% false seals) and effectively dead (2.4%
paraphrase recall). At 0.92 it serves more real rewrites and gets one in six
answers wrong. Every cutoff is bad at one of the two jobs, on both corpora.

That is a limit of character-ratio matching, not of threshold choice, and it is
now the strongest argument on this list for §3.1/§3.3 — widening the seam so a
semantic matcher can be used at all. Tuning `SEAL_THRESHOLD` cannot fix it.

Note the two corpora are not equally stressed: a synonym swap in an 11-word
boilerplate phrase changes ~9% of its tokens, while dropping one stopword from a
long prose sentence changes far less (paraphrase score p50 is 0.0 — i.e. below
the 0.80 floor — for boilerplate, versus 0.95 for prose). The direction holds on
both; the magnitudes are not comparable across corpora.

**Two separate scaling stories, and the prose one is worse than it looks.**
Boilerplate degrades faster with size (0.4% → 16.4%) but is a synthetic worst
case. Prose is real English and still reaches 6.8% at only 4,000 pairs, with a
score distribution whose p50 is ~0.48 — i.e. the *average* probe is nowhere near
danger and the tail still clears 0.98. A diverse corpus feels safe and is not,
because real corpora contain genuine near-duplicates.

The paraphrase tier that settles this was added in `corpora.py`: meaning-
preserving rewrites (synonym substitution from a curated table, clause
reordering, contraction, and a guaranteed stopword-drop fallback) that survive
normalization. 0% of boilerplate and 5% of prose paraphrases normalize to an
identical key, against 80% for the surface tier.

Longer term this still wants to be per-domain, or a calibration mode that
samples a corpus, measures its absent-score distribution, and recommends a
cutoff for a target false-seal rate — which is also the honest marketing story
(§4.2): not "we are accurate," but "here is your false-verification rate, and
here is the dial."

### 1.4 Seal staleness and quorum — **open**

Every seal is equally authoritative forever, and one verifier is enough. Neither
is obviously right for a regulated buyer. Worth considering: seal age surfaced
in provenance; a `weight` that decays; N-of-M verification for high-stakes
domains. The ledger already records who sealed what and when, so the data is
there — nothing consumes it.

## 2. Performance — the scan

**measured** (`fill.py`, session of 2026-07-25; to be folded into a bench):
lookup is linear in corpus size — 293 ms @ 2k pairs, 4.4 s @ 32k, projecting to
~135 s @ 1M. **97% of that is Python-side `difflib`, not SQL** (112 ms fetch vs
4,260 ms scoring at 32k). The database is not the bottleneck; the scoring loop is.

### 2.1 Lossless prefilter via difflib's own bounds — **measured**

`SequenceMatcher` exposes `real_quick_ratio()` (length-based) and
`quick_ratio()` (multiset-based) as progressively tighter upper bounds on
`ratio()`. Confirmed in-repo on 20,000 random pairs:
`ratio() <= quick_ratio() <= real_quick_ratio()`, no violations.

So candidates whose upper bound cannot beat the incumbent best can be skipped
**without computing `ratio()` at all, and without changing a single result.**
Implemented as `bench.bench_accuracy.best_match_fast` and measured against the
naive scan over 120 probes, **0 disagreements** on both corpora:

| Corpus | Rows | Naive | Pruned | Speedup |
|--------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| boilerplate | 3,000 | 39.1 s | 10.1 s | **3.9x** |
| prose | 2,991 | 52.6 s | 50.9 s | **1.0x** |

**The prose result is the interesting one.** Pruning only bites once a *high*
incumbent exists — on diverse prose the best score stays low (p50 ≈ 0.49), the
bound almost never falls below it, and nothing gets skipped. So as a general
speedup this is corpus-dependent and worth much less than it first looks.

**But `best_sealed` doesn't need the argmax — it needs "anything ≥ threshold."**
Seeding the incumbent at the threshold instead of `0.0` makes every candidate
below it skippable from the first row rather than only after a good match turns
up. Implemented as `best_match_fast(..., floor=)` and measured on *absent*
probes — the case that previously pruned worst:

| Corpus | Naive | floor=0.0 | floor=0.80 |
|--------|------:|----------:|-----------:|
| prose 4,000 | 22.1 s | 18.9 s (1.2x) | **2.5 s (8.8x)** |
| boilerplate 24,000 | 94.2 s | 15.3 s (6.1x) | 15.5 s (6.1x) |

Zero disagreements above the floor in both. The floor is what rescues prose,
exactly as predicted; boilerplate gains nothing extra because every probe there
already scores above 0.80, so nothing is censored. This turned a 24k row that
had failed to finish in 53 minutes into ~5 minutes, and made the complete
7-row sweep possible.

**Ship this in `best_sealed`.** `lookup()` cannot use it — it must return
sub-threshold candidates as engine context — so it wants to be a distinct fast
path, not a change to the shared scan.

Two caveats found while implementing it, both easy to get wrong:

* **`ratio()` is not symmetric.** `StringMatcher` computes
  `SequenceMatcher(None, probe, row)`. Swapping the operands to let difflib
  cache its `b2j` index across candidates measures a different function.
* **`autojunk` changes results** on sequences of 200+ elements, so it must be
  left at the default.

Both would produce a plausible, slightly-wrong benchmark. The equivalence check
(`--equiv`) exists because of them.

Do this before anything lossy.

### 2.2 Trigram blocking — **measured, disappointing**

A 4-gram prefilter gave only **2.4x** (4,372 ms → 1,818 ms) because 43% of
candidates survived it. That number is from the homogeneous boilerplate corpus,
which is the worst case for blocking — on diverse prose it should do far better,
and that is worth measuring before judging the idea. Lossy, unlike §2.1.

### 2.3 Index `source_norm` — **measured**

`memory_find` runs on every `add_pair` and there is no index on `source_norm`
(only `(source_lang, target_lang, status)`). Adding one cut ingest from
~10.1 s/1k to ~4.5 s/1k at 32k rows — **2.3x**, one line of DDL.

### 2.4 Connection-per-operation — **open**

`SqliteStore._db()` opens and closes a fresh connection for every call on
file-backed databases, and `add_pair` additionally calls `memory_init()`, which
replays the whole schema script each time. I hypothesised this dominated ingest
and **was wrong** — stubbing `memory_init` out made things marginally *slower*,
i.e. it is noise at this scale. Recorded here so nobody re-derives the same dead
end. The connection churn may still matter under concurrency; unmeasured.

---

## 3. The Matcher seam

### 3.1 The seam is lossy by construction — **verified**

`normalize(value) -> str` is the *only* channel between a raw input and
`similarity(a_norm, b_norm)`. Scoring never sees the originals. I lost an
acronym match (`AWS` → `Amazon Web Services`) purely because my normalizer
sorted its tokens, and the information needed to recover it no longer existed by
scoring time.

Worse, that same string is simultaneously the store's exact-match dedup key in
`memory_find`. Scoring wants rich structure; deduplication wants aggressive
collapse. **These two jobs pull in opposite directions, and one string serves
both.**

Proposal: an optional second method — `score(raw_a, raw_b)` — that the memory
prefers when present, leaving `normalize` free to be a pure dedup key. This is
the change that unblocks embedding/semantic matchers, which currently cannot be
expressed without smuggling a vector through a SQL key.

### 3.2 Recipes the seam already supports — **verified**

Written from outside the package, with **zero changes to `nestor/`**:

- **`DateMatcher`** — normalizes `Q3 2025`, `September 30, 2025` and
  `30/09/2025` to one ordinal; scores by day-window tolerance. A temporal
  alignment engine with sealed provenance, for ~30 lines.
- **Schema mapping** — messy CSV headers → canonical field names, using
  `EntityResolver` **unchanged**, just with a token matcher. `'TOTAL DUE'` →
  `amount_due` at 1.0; `'Name of Customer'` correctly queued for review at 0.667.

The README advertises three recipes. The seam supports a category. That gap is a
positioning problem more than an engineering one (§4.1).

### 3.3 Semantic matcher — **open**

Blocked on §3.1. Would fix the acronym/synonym class of misses outright. Cost:
the first real dependency in a currently zero-dependency package — which is a
genuine selling point to the regulated buyer, so this should probably live as an
optional extra, never core.

---

## 4. Positioning

### 4.1 Lead with the mechanic, not translation — **open**

The README opens with translation and reaches the general mechanic four sections
down. Everything I found suggests the general mechanic *is* the product and
translation is the origin story. Restructure so the first screen is
seal → serve → audit, with translation as one recipe among several.

### 4.2 The category is AI verification, not translation memory — **open**

Tier 2 is an AI draft explicitly queued for review; tier 3 is a human sealing it;
tier 1 is that seal served forever — all in a tamper-evident chain. That is a
direct answer to "which model outputs did a human actually check," which nobody
has solved and every regulated buyer is being asked.

The economic shape is the strong part: each human verification is **permanent
capital**. Cost per answer falls as trust rises — an unusual curve worth leading
with. Candidate line: *"Verified once. Served forever."*

Where it wins: high-value, low-volume decisions — contracts, clinical notes,
regulatory filings. Where it loses: high-volume chat, per §2 numbers. Don't
pitch into the second; the demo would lose.

### 4.3 The 60-second demo — **open**

Highest-leverage missing artifact. An AI gets something wrong; a human corrects
it **once**; it is right forever after, with a receipt that cannot be forged.
Then tamper with the ledger and watch the chain refuse. That is the entire
product in one loop, and it lands on an engineer and a compliance officer for
different reasons.

Blocked on §5.1 — there is currently nothing to run.

### 4.4 The bench is a marketing asset — **open**

"We are accurate" is a claim a compliance buyer knows is a lie. "Here is our
measured false-verification rate, here is the dial that sets it, here is the
harness — run it yourself" is stronger *because* it admits a failure rate.
Publishing `bench/results/` is a differentiator, not an exposure.

---

## 5. Missing surface

### 5.1 There is no CLI — **verified**

No `console_scripts`, no entry point, nothing to run without writing Python.
`nestor seal / resolve / check / ledger verify` would cost little and is the
prerequisite for §4.3.

### 5.2 The memory is write-only — **shipped**

*Was: `Storage` had no list, unseal, delete or export. A pair could be sealed but
never browsed, inspected, revoked or exported — so for a system whose whole value
is human verification, the human could not see what they had verified.*

`nestor.curator.Curator` is that surface: `list` (filter by status / verifier /
substring, paginated), `get` (full provenance plus every rejection recorded
against the pair), `unverifiable`, `unseal`, `restore`, `export`, `summary`.
Backed by an optional all-or-nothing `Storage` capability
(`supports_curation`), on the same terms as rejection.

Three decisions worth keeping:

* **Every row reports `servable`, not just `status`.** That column runs the same
  `is_verified_seal` predicate the serve path uses, so it answers "would Nestor
  actually serve this?" rather than "does the row say sealed?". `unverifiable()`
  lists the difference — with signing on, those are rows written by something
  that never held the seal key. Nothing else surfaces them.
* **Unseal is not reject.** Unsealing returns a pair to `draft` for
  re-verification; rejecting retires it as wrong. A curator who is merely unsure
  should not have to choose between destroying a mapping and leaving a seal
  standing they no longer trust. Unseal clears `seal_sig` — a `draft` row still
  carrying a valid signature is a seal waiting to be reactivated by anything
  that flips the status column back.
* **Revocation is ledgered** (`unseal`, `restore`). A trail that records every
  grant of trust and no withdrawal of it is not an audit trail.

**Building this found a real bug in §1.2.** `add_pair` resurrected rejected
pairs: a curator rejected a bad mapping and the next `graduate_segment` over the
same source text silently re-sealed it — precisely the leak rejection existed to
close. `add_pair` now raises `RejectedPairError` instead, so a host driving a
review queue can surface it as what it is: one human asserting the opposite of
another's recorded decision. `Curator.restore` is the deliberate way back, and it
returns to `draft` rather than `sealed`, because a mapping someone once called
wrong should be re-verified rather than reinstated.

Still missing: no `memory_delete`. Deliberate for now — rejection and unsealing
preserve the audit trail, and hard deletion would punch a hole in it. A GDPR-style
erasure path would need to be designed against the ledger, not bolted on.

### 5.3 Ledger verification is once per process — **verified**

`cascade._verified_ledgers` caches by path, so the chain is checked on first
append and never again. I watched an append succeed after mid-run tampering. The
cache is a deliberate cost trade, but a long-lived process will not notice
tampering that happens while it runs. Options: periodic re-verification, verify
the tail only, or make the cache TTL'd. Related: `verify()` cost grows linearly
with ledger length, so checkpointing may be needed before re-verification is
affordable.
