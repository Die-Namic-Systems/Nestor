# What is left

The queue now lives in [`docs/ideas.md`](docs/ideas.md) — the same items, in
the same priority order, as a numbered pile willow-reconciler reads (top-level
`N. ` items whose numbers are permanent join keys; a commit that lands one
carries its `Idea-Id` trailer, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`). Longer arguments live in
[`IDEAS.md`](IDEAS.md) (each entry tagged **measured / verified / hypothesis /
open / shipped**) and [`QUESTIONS.md`](QUESTIONS.md) (what this gets asked, and
the honest "not yet"s). If the pile disagrees with one of those, they are right
and it is stale. This file keeps only the note below, which the codebase cites
by name.

## A note on how this repo finds things

Four of the six defects fixed on 2026-07-31 were the same shape: **a guarantee
enforced by convention at call sites, and a second path into the store that never
passes it.** Rejection lived in `add_pair` and the import path walked around it.
The seal audit lived in the callers and `add_pair` did not have it. One row per
source was assumed by four modules and enforced by none.

If you add a write path, the question to ask is not "did I remember the guard" —
it is "can this guard be reached around", and then move the rule into the one
place that cannot be bypassed. `IDEAS.md` §1.6, §1.7 and §1.8 are the three
worked examples. [`docs/code-review-lessons.md`](docs/code-review-lessons.md)
collects the pre-PR checklist from the PR #22–#24 review rounds.

The same test retired the held-back bench branch: it carried a second review
surface, weaker than `nestor.ui`, that could seal into the same store. The
dashboard landed and the playground did not. Two paths in, one of them
unguarded, is the defect — it does not stop being one because it is a UI.

And a variant worth naming separately, from the same day's work: **a guarantee
that only holds where somebody thought to look.** `best_sealed` filtered
`lookup()`'s top five, so a verified seal ranked sixth was invisible to tier 1.
Nothing was bypassed and no rule was missed; the code just answered a narrower
question than the one it was asked. That one is only found by asking what the
code does when the easy case does not hold.
